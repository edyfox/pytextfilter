# pyTextFilter

[TextEditAid](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/textaid/ppoadiihggafnhokfkpphojggcdigllp)
is a Google Chrome extension which allows you to edit the contents of a textarea
on a web page. In order to use that extension, you'll need an edit-server
running on your computer. This project is an implementation of that edit-server
written in Python, with better portability.
