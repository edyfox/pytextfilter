# pyTextFilter

[TextAid](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/textaid/ppoadiihggafnhokfkpphojggcdigllp) is a Google Chrome extension
which allows you to edit the contents of a textarea on a web page.
In order to use that extension,
you'll need an edit-server running on your computer.
[Here](http://opencoder.net/edit-server)'s a simple edit-server provided by the author of TextAid.

This project is a re-implementation of that simple edit-server written in Python,
with better portability.
